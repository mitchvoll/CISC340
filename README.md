# CISC340_PROJECT_1
All project files are in /_main_. The file _main_.ino is the main program that contains the navigation logic and component usage logic. The other files are for component functions so we can avoid lots of merge conflicts from working on the same file. 

The entire folder compiles so that functions written in each file are usable in _main_.ino so you should be able to build your function and test it from the _main_ file. If you have access to an Arduino let me know if you get output in the serial monitor with the current config, I don't have my Arduino so I couldn't test it.
